		<h3> Killer Instinct</h3><br>
        <aside class="cat"><h3> History</h3><br><p>
        Killer Instinct is an old video-game released on Arcade in 1994. At the time, this game was revolutionary, both in the technical aspect and by its playability. At the time , it was the "Street Fighter VS Mortal Kombat" war. And then, Killer Instinct, out of nowhere, and it changed the situation. <br></aside>
        <aside class="cat"><h3> Performances</h3><br>
        <p>
         On the technical side : a revolution. Real 3D backgrounds, 3D rendered characters brought back in 2D by compression (usual technique of Rareware, creator studio of the game, and the Donkey Kong Country game. It was also the first or one of the first Arcade cabinet wich integrated a real Hard Drive for musics and graphics.<br></aside>
        <aside class="gameplay"><h3> Gameplay</h3><br><p>
        In the gameplay side, never seen. This wasn't a Round fight system, but a double life bar system, giving an extraordinary fluidity to the game. For the fight itself, the combo system is cruelly effective, giving hallucinatory possibilities. Where Street Fighter was giving only 2 or 3 hits combos, that where not really integrated to the game, Killer Instinct offers the possibility of more than a dozen hit combo each (personnaly, without cheating, my record amounts to 43 hits). <br>
        Combos were technical to go out. You needed an opener, for starting, and  Il fallait un coup d’ouverture, de commencement, then enchain combinations with the "Linkers", puis enchaîner les combinaisons avec des « Linkers », hits that connect transitions with opening ones. However, there's a limit. We can't chain more than a certain number of hits with this system. Which is ingenious, this gives a balance.</aside>
        <h3> Personal Opinion</h3><br><p>
        This game was intended to be released on the Nintendo 64 (called Utra 64 at the time), but the console was delayed more and more, and so the game released on the Super Nintendo (the SNES). And even if it's not in full 3D, the game worth it. The system is the same, some bug corrections of the original version and musics always to the top (the cd was even included with the SNES game).<br>
        This game is all of my childhood, I still play it very regularly, and without wanting to brag, I became an expert at this game. I know all combinations, codes, and I have more than 13 years of experience, and almost unbeatable, only my little brother can beat me. <br>
        This is a game that I recommend, even on emulator, it's a killing.<br>
        Here is a video that I realised myself (Caution, don't skip too far, because it may have a gap between the sound and the picture) :</p>
