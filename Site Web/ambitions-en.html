    <h3 class="article_h3">My ambitions</h3>
    <p><h3>My Passions</h3><p>
    I have multiple passions
    I love old video-games, I love music, I love electronics, tinker,
    collect old computers (in addition it's ecological), fabricate, create.
    But I have preferences in my passions.<br>
    My number one passion, it's music. I always loved listening to it, but also to create it.
    Make a electronic music producer professional career is my childhood dream, and I intend to get there.<br>
    However, to be able to do well, I need good equipement, and it cost a lot of money. 
    And so I need a stable job before realizing this dream.
    And that's where my studies comes in. I'm keen on old video games, I'd like to create some on my own.<br>
    However it takes knowledge which are very hard to have by self-education (and I know whet I'm talking about, I tried to code alone, and it didn't work very well).<br>
    So at high school, i took the IT speciality, to introduce me to coding, and I decided to continue my studies at Saint-Dié in IT.<br>
    Work in the video-games, or IT in general, it's also <strong>this</strong> the thing I want.
    I don't know yet if I will continue after. It will be done according to my motivation, according to my desire.<br>
    <h3><strong>But place to the question of the future.</strong></h3><br>
    <p>How do I see myself in 10, 20 or even 30 years ?<br>
    <p>For 10 years, I think that the first 5 years will be dedicated in search of money for my dreams, and eventually, after 10 years, work in the video game industry.<br>
    Once this done, I will try to commit myself in my dreams career. 5-7 years of transition, where I mix my video-game job, and the music in solo.<br>
    Now it's just a supposition. In the worst case, after 7 years, I am caught. I'll have to wait if what I'm doing works..<br>
    I think I will need 3 or 5 years more where here, I will be in the 2nd transition phase.<br>
    I earn money with my video-game job, and with my music producer career.<br>
    Once these 3-5 years done, where I can make music my main job, I resign in my video-game job, and I'm going deep into music. Until the end of everything.<br><br>
    Here is what I think of my future, all is only suppositions, hypotheses, because I don't know if everything will go as I think.
